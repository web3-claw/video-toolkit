# claude-code-video-toolkit

[![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/digitalsamba/claude-code-video-toolkit)](https://github.com/digitalsamba/claude-code-video-toolkit/releases)

An AI-native video production workspace for [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code). Skills, commands, templates, and tools that give Claude Code everything it needs to help you create professional videos — from concept to final render.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/digitalsamba/claude-code-video-toolkit.git
cd claude-code-video-toolkit
pip install -r tools/requirements.txt   # Optional: for AI voiceover, image gen, music
claude                                   # Open Claude Code in the toolkit
```

Then in Claude Code:

```
/setup                    # Configure cloud GPU, storage, voice (~5 min, mostly free)
/video                    # Create your first video
```

**That's it.** `/setup` walks you through everything interactively — cloud GPU provider, file transfer, voice config. `/video` creates a project from a template and guides you through the whole workflow.

**What's free:** The toolkit leans heavily on open-source AI models — voiceovers (Qwen3-TTS), image generation (FLUX.2), music (ACE-Step), and more. You deploy them to your own cloud GPU account and run them at cost. Cloudflare R2 has a generous free tier (10GB, zero egress), and Modal gives $30/month free compute on the Starter plan — more than enough for a few 5-minute videos a month.

**Requirements:** [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 18+ and [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code). Python 3.9+ recommended for AI tools. FFmpeg optional.

> **Want to skip setup and just render something?**
> ```bash
> cd examples/hello-world && npm install && npm run render
> ```
> No API keys needed — outputs an MP4 immediately.

## A Note from the Author *(not AI-generated)*

> I've spent months painstakingly putting this toolkit together and plan to keep iterating on it. AI makes things easier, but hard work still has huge value. Every video I create is a chance for improvement — every skill, template, tool, and workflow here has been refined through that cycle. It would be wonderful if others wanted to get involved with that: use it, refine it, and feed back into the repo via an issue or PR what you learn.
>
> My own use case is fairly specific: creating sprint review videos for the AI mobile development arm of [Digital Samba](https://www.digitalsamba.com/). But the idea behind this project is a reusable toolkit for using Claude Code to autonomously generate any kind of "explainer" style video — product demos, walkthroughs, presentations, whatever you need. Autonomous video creation is a lofty ideal for such a subjective field, but we can try :)
>
> What makes this work is that Claude Code is fantastically resourceful and flexible — give it the framing and tooling that this toolkit provides and it will adapt it to create templates and videos based on your prompting. The skills, templates, and tools here are building blocks. Claude Code is the builder. You are the director, editor, and designer.
>
> **If you're getting started**, run `/setup` then `/video` and let Claude Code guide you. Or start with `/template` to create a template for your own use case.
>
> **Cloud GPU** — I recommend [Modal](https://modal.com/) for running the toolkit's AI tools. The Starter plan gives you $30/month free compute, which is more than enough. [RunPod](https://runpod.io/) is also supported as an alternative. Run `/setup` to deploy the tools you need.
>
> My motto: **Be brave. Experiment.** And please share any videos you create or ideas you have back with the project — it helps me keep improving this toolkit for everyone.

### Scene Transitions

The toolkit includes a transitions library for scene-to-scene effects:

| Transition | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `glitch()` | Digital distortion with RGB shift |
| `rgbSplit()` | Chromatic aberration effect |
| `zoomBlur()` | Radial motion blur |
| `lightLeak()` | Cinematic lens flare |
| `clockWipe()` | Radial sweep reveal |
| `pixelate()` | Digital mosaic dissolution |
| `checkerboard()` | Grid-based reveal (9 patterns) |

Plus official Remotion transitions: `slide()`, `fade()`, `wipe()`, `flip()`

Preview all transitions:
```bash
cd showcase/transitions && npm install && npm run studio
```

See [lib/transitions/README.md](lib/transitions/README.md) for full documentation.

### Brand Profiles

Define visual identity in `brands/`. When you create a project with `/video`, the brand's colors, fonts, and styling are automatically applied.

```
brands/my-brand/
├── brand.json    # Colors, fonts, typography
├── voice.json    # ElevenLabs voice settings
└── assets/       # Logo, backgrounds
```

Included brands: `default`, `digital-samba`

Create your own with `/brand`.

### Project Management System

Video projects are tracked through a multi-session lifecycle:

```
planning → assets → review → audio → editing → rendering → complete
```

Each project has a `project.json` that tracks:
- **Scenes** — What to show, asset status, visual types
- **Audio** — Voiceover and music status
- **Sessions** — Work history across Claude Code sessions
- **Phase** — Current stage in the workflow

The system automatically reconciles intent (what you planned) with reality (what files exist), and generates a `CLAUDE.md` per project for instant context when resuming.

See [lib/project/README.md](lib/project/README.md) for schema details, scene status tracking, and filesystem reconciliation logic.

### Python Tools

Audio, video, and image tools in `tools/`:

```bash
# Generate voiceover (ElevenLabs)
python tools/voiceover.py --script script.md --output voiceover.mp3

# Generate voiceover (Qwen3-TTS — self-hosted, cheaper alternative)

**Tool Categories:**

| Type | Tools | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| **Project** | voiceover, music, music_gen, sfx | Used during video creation workflow |
| **Utility** | redub, addmusic, notebooklm_brand, locate_watermark | Quick transformations, no project needed |
| **Cloud GPU** | image_edit, upscale, dewatermark, sadtalker, qwen3_tts, flux2, music_gen, ltx2 | AI processing via Modal or RunPod |

### Cloud GPU (Modal + RunPod)

8 AI tools run on cloud GPUs. Use `--cloud modal` (recommended) or `--cloud runpod` on any tool.

| Tool | What It Does | Est. Cost |
|------|--------------|-----------|
| `qwen3_tts` | AI text-to-speech (9 speakers, voice cloning) | ~$0.01 |
| `flux2` | AI image generation & editing | ~$0.02 |
| `image_edit` | AI image editing & style transfer | ~$0.03 |
| `upscale` | AI image upscaling (2x/4x) | ~$0.01 |
| `music_gen` | AI music generation (8 scene presets) | Free (acemusic) / ~$0.05 (self-hosted) |
| `sadtalker` | Talking head video from portrait + audio | ~$0.10 |
| `ltx2` | AI video generation (text-to-video, image-to-video) | ~$0.23 |
| `dewatermark` | Video watermark removal | ~$0.10 |

**Modal (recommended):** Each tool deploys from `docker/modal-*/app.py` — Modal builds and hosts the containers. $30/month free compute on the Starter plan, typical usage is $1-2/month. Run `/setup` to deploy all tools automatically.

**RunPod (alternative):** Uses pre-built Docker images from `ghcr.io/conalmullan/video-toolkit-*`. Pay-per-second, no minimums. Run `python3 tools/<tool>.py --setup` to create endpoints.

See [docs/modal-setup.md](docs/modal-setup.md) and [docs/runpod-setup.md](docs/runpod-setup.md) for details.
